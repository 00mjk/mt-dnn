0	neutral	Based on the list provided of the uses of substances 1-7, estimate the pH of each unknown and record the number in the data table in the estimated pH column.	If a substance has a ph value greater than 7,that indicates that it is base.

2	neutral	At high temperatures, the solid dye converts into a gas without ever becoming a liquid.	Gases and liquids become solids at low temperatures.
3	neutral	Chapter 11 Gas and Kinetic Theory .	The behavior of ideal gases is explained by kinetic molecular theory.
